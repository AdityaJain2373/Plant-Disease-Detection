# Plant-Disease-Detection

Welcome to the Potato Disease Prediction project! This project aims to identify potato diseases from leaf images using machine learning techniques and provide real-time predictions through a web interface built with Flask.

Key Features

      1. Machine Learning Model: Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify potato diseases.
      2. Web Application: Built a Flask web application to provide an interface for users to upload potato leaf images and receive predictions.

Technologies Used

      1. Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
      2. Web Development: Flask, HTML, JavaScript

Future Improvements

      1. Improve model accuracy by collecting more diverse datasets.
      2. Enhance user interface for better user experience.
      3. Upload it on a interface like AWS.
